# **BMPstat**

This module provides a set of functions for working with BMP images at the byte level, specifically for accessing and manipulating individual pixels and sublayers (bits) in a BMP image. The module allows you to obtain and manipulate an image's pixel array, taking into account factors such as data offset, padding, and line format.
